# Efficiency

Since I can remember, I've been wired to think deeply about efficiency. I'm not sure why God made me this way, but it manifests in the way I think about solutions and the way I operate on a day to day basis. This post encapsulates my thoughts on efficiency.

## No Solutions, Only Tradeoffs

At the highest level, efficiency is the ratio of effort to output. It is less intuitive that within this framework there are subdomains of efficiency which often compete. Efficiency is expressed differently in the three domains of value: time, money, and energy.

### Time

Time is the only non-renewable resource in our lives. We can never gain more time. Because it is non-renewable because we are never able to recover our investment. If we spend 40 hours developing a new project, we can never recover those 40 hours. We can never recover time, we can only convert it. At the end of those 40 hours, we gain the output of our investment.

The realized value of our time is determined by the larger economic structures we exist within. Within capitalistic economic structures, the value of our time is highly correlated with the economic output we can command by it. Because of this, the realized value of our time can fluctuate throughout our life; typically, increasing as we gain more valuable experience.

Outside of economics, due to its finite nature, our time has a sentimental value. At the end of our lives, we will look back at the way we spent our time and judge ourselves accordingly. This is why we often hear that people near the end of their lives wished they had spent more time with their loved ones, or they had spent more time doing the things they love.

### Money

Money is a limited, renewable resource. Unlike time, we can usually recover part of our investment. For instance, if we spend $100 on a new pair of shoes, we might be able to sell them for $50 and recover a portion of our investment.

Money is a highly liquid resource. It is very easy to convert money into either time or energy. We can spend money to save time and use that time to gain energy. We can also often spend money on energy gaining activities.

### Energy

If we have an ambition to do something, if we have the time and money to do it, it still cannot be done without energy.

Energy is the fuel that drives effort; it is a semi-renewable resource. Similar to time, we cannot recover our invest. We can only convert it. But, similar to money, we can gain more of it. Energy is a function of our health and our ability to rest. Rest is not the same as sleep. Sleep is a subset of rest. Rest is a state of mind, sleep is a state of body. Rest is the ability to relax and recharge; which will look different for each individual.

## Tradeoffs

The tradeoffs between time, money, and energy are often subtle. You can perform certain actions to optimize each domain.

Many people determine the value of their time according to the value of their time determined by their employer. If you are paid $50/hour, you will likely value your time at $50/hour. The value of one's time is typically far greater than the value of one's time determined by their employer. This is because time can be converted into much more valuable resources than money can be converted to; but, to survive, you often need to convert your time into money. If you have $50, you can buy a variety of things that can bring value to your life. But, with 1 hour, you can do infinitely many things. You can learn a new skill, you can spend time with your family, you can read a book, you can write a blog post.

The most common example is the tradeoff between time and money. You can easily exchange time for money or vice versa. A simple task like mowing your yard can be done in 30 minutes. You can pay someone to do it for you. If it takes you 1 hour to mow your yard, you would likely pay someone up to $50 to do it for you.

Energy tradeoffs are more complex. Without deliberate introspection and tracking, it is hard to determine which energy tradeoffs will result in a net positive gain. For instance, we might hesitate to spend an hour walking during a busy workday. Yet, you might be missing out on the opportunity to gain more energy which can increase your productivity and thus, overall, improve the ratio of your effort to output.

## Conclusion

Navigating the tradeoffs between these 3 domains is a complex optimization problem. I've tried to optimize the ratio of effort to output by doing small experiments within each domain.
